-- Takes a version 57 database to version 58: an architect's question to the owner waits for the owner only while a
-- matter it holds is still open, neither handled nor withdrawn, so that one whose matter is gone no longer counts as
-- waiting in the owner's conversations, where the page has no way to clear it. Each statement below that defines
-- something is written exactly as db/schema.sql writes it.

CREATE VIEW conversation_entries AS
  -- Every entry of the owner's conversations, gathered from the tables that hold them: a group for each engineer's
  -- work, whose members are the owner, its engineer and its project's architect (what the engineer and the architect
  -- tell and ask the owner and each other about the work, the architect's messages while it handles a matter of the
  -- work, the owner's words to either or both and the architect's reply to its own, the design cards and the rulings
  -- on them, and the engine's notices about it); the owner's one-to-one with each project's architect (the owner's
  -- words to it and its replies, those a flow version before took while a talk with it was open being entries of that
  -- talk, what it tells and asks the owner about no work, in its works and in the settings of its policy a flow
  -- version before ran); one for the architects of projects the configuration connects (what they say
  -- to each other, and the owner's words to them); and one of wf-agents itself (its faults, and what the engine tells
  -- the owner about no work). The owner's words said to the architect's work in hand or to its policy setting while it
  -- runs, and its answers to them, are in the one-to-one, whatever matter it handles. A work's helpers (its advisor,
  -- review and adversarial testing) are in no group: what they and the engineer say to each other is in the work's
  -- rounds.
  -- Hidden from agents.
  -- Read by: the owner's interface, which lists the conversations, counts what waits and what is unread in each, and
  -- shows each.
  -- conversation is work:<id>, architect:<project>, architects:<project>[|<project>] (the projects' architects; the
  -- interface takes it to the group of every project the configuration connects them with), or wf-agents. source is
  -- what the entry is (message, notice, ask, interjection, words, talk, question, report, reply, card, ruling or
  -- between) and id its row in the table it comes from; an ask is one entry, the owner's answer to it shown in it, never
  -- an entry of its own beside it. sender and recipient are a line, the owner, the engine or wf-agents, the recipient of
  -- the owner's words in a work's group the engineer, the architect or both, and in the one-to-one the line of the
  -- architect's work they were said to (architect or policy); for between, the projects. matter: the architect's
  -- matter the entry is, or holds the owner's words of, or whose talk it is an entry of. waiting: it waits for the
  -- owner (an ask that stands for an open blocker the owner holds, or an architect's ask that holds a matter still
  -- open, neither handled nor withdrawn, not answered; a design card not ruled while its work goes on; a fault not
  -- read). pending: the owner's words not taken
  -- up yet. undelivered: the owner's words to an agent that its work ended without taking in. answerable: an
  -- engineer's question the architect holds now, which the owner may answer in the group instead.
